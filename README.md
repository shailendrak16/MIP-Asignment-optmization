# MIP-Asignment-optmization
Example
In the example there are five workers (numbered 0-4) and four tasks (numbered 0-3). Note that there is one more worker than in the example in the Overview.

The costs of assigning workers to tasks are shown in the following table.

0	1	2	3

0	90	80	75	70

1	35	85	55	65

2	125	95	90	95

3	45	110	95	115

4	50	100	90	100

The problem is to assign each worker to at most one task, with no two workers performing the same task, while minimizing the total cost. Since there are more workers than tasks, one worker will not be assigned a task.
